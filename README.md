* **Packer:**  If you don't have Packer already, you'll need to install it.  Follow the [Packer installation instructions](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#bootstrapping).  (Usually just cloning it into your `nvim/autoload` directory).

**Installation - Get Setup in a Breeze!**

1. **Backup (Optional but Recommended):**  If you have an existing Neovim configuration, it's always a good idea to back it up before making changes!

2. **Clone this Repository:**  Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory.  This is typically:
   * **Linux/macOS:** `~/.config/nvim/`
   * **Windows:** `~/AppData/Local/nvim/`

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ajinkya-Manoj-Shinde/NVim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
